<a name="welcome-to-my-github-page" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-my-github-page"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my GitHub Page.</h3>

<p>This page was mostly generated automatically by just pressing a button. I'm still a noob at GitHub. I joined GitHub because it appears that a great deal of free software development for the Raspberry Pi is taking place here. I got started when I cloned a repository onto my Rasberry Pi that serves a web app page to control the camera. That app install required Git and also Node to be installed on my Pi. I signed up for a GitHub account and forked the NodeBeginnersBook. In the course of watching how-to videos I discovered that Git was developed by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system. Apparently he wrote it because all the other collaborative software development tools are crap. </p>

<p>I have managed to 'push' my BerryCam app folder back up to my GitHub repo but I think I made a mistake and uploaded the 'dependency files' that were required after the cloning of the developer's repository.</p>

<p>This is my first use of GitHub pages as a way of publishing a static page on the Internet. At this stage I haven't really edited anything beyond this sentence as you can see --&gt;. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
